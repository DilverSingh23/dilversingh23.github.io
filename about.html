                <p> I am a second-year computer science student at the Macaulay Honors College @ CUNY Queens College.
                I have over 2 years of front-end development experience and I am well versed in languages such as
                C++, HTML and CSS along with a great understanding of developer tools like Git. I am currently a 
                Web Developer at Jupiter Leo Productions and obtaining exposure in OOP using Java and front-end with Javascript.
                I am seeking full-stack or software engineering roles to contribute fresh perspectives to teams and
                build robust full-stack applications that make an impact.
